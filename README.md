## About Me

I am Daksh Jain, a passionate computer science student currently navigating the thrilling world of algorithms and code. 🚀 This portfolio is a reflection of my journey in technology, where I explore various domains, including data science and machine learning. When I'm not coding, you can find me pondering the mysteries of the universe, like why is it that we park on driveways and drive on parkways?

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL (the art of asking databases to do what I want)
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask, Django (because who doesn't love a good library? 🎉)

## Projects

1. **Virtual Assistant (Nova)**: A Python-based virtual assistant that helps you manage daily tasks. Think of it as your personal sidekick but without the superhero costume!
2. **Portfolio Website**: This very website you’re visiting, designed to showcase my skills and projects. You might even find it more attractive than your average cat video! 🐱

## My Code Repositories

For those who love to learn as much as I do, check out my repository at [Python Data Science Libraries](https://github.com/itsdakshjain/Python-Data-Science-Libraries). Here, I'm documenting my learning journey, writing down concepts and codes for Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. It’s a place where knowledge grows like a well-watered plant (or at least I hope so)!
